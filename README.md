## [Text To Voice Converter](https://github.com/sakshimunde18/Text-To-Voice-Converter/tree/main/lib)

A few years ago, text-to-voice apps may have sounded like a far-fetched idea. However, with technology advancing rapidly, we now talk to computers and gadgets as if they’re another person. Voice recognition can help make life easier and has reduced multi-step tasks to a few simple lines.

## Abstract
A Text-to-speech synthesizer is an application that converts text into spoken word, by analyzing and processing the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and then using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technology to convert this processed text into synthesized speech representation of the text. Here, we developed a useful text-to-speech synthesizer in the form of a simple application that converts inputted text into synthesized speech and reads out to the user which can then be saved as an mp3. file. The development of a text to speech synthesizer will be of great help to people with visual impairment and make making through large volume of text easier.
	Text-to-speech systems, also known as TTS, were first developed to aid the visually impaired by offering a computer-generated spoken voice that would “read” text to the user. TTS allows users to see text and hear it read aloud simultaneously. Very often the user has a choice of gender and accent as well. Text-to-speech tools are often used with optical character recognition (OCR). OCR is a technology that scans printed material into a computer or handheld unit and converts it to digital text.

## Introduction

Text-to-speech synthesis -TTS - is the automatic conversion of a text into speech that resembles, as closely as possible, a native speaker of the language reading that text. Text-to-speech synthesizer (TTS) is the technology which lets computer speak to you. The TTS system gets the text as the input and then a computer algorithm which called TTS engine analyses the text, pre-processes the text and synthesizes the speech with some mathematical models. The TTS engine usually generates sound data in an audio format as the output.

## Necessity
	
Suppose you are such a person who has the capability to write well but lacks confidence while speaking. Or sometimes, you do not know how to pronounce vocabulary words, phrases, or sentences correctly in English or in other languages. Then you do not need to worry at all. The advancement in life manners and technology has provided several solutions to this problem. One of the best of them is to use Text to Speech Conversion. 
	Text to Speak is one of the excellent and most popular features presented by multiple online sites these days. It is usually called TTS technology, which instantly speaks the entire textual content that a user puts into a TTS online tool.

## Objective

Text to Speech by is the finest and latest technology that is able to read online or digital text clearly and in a louder tone. The technology scans the written texts on the computer screens or on any electronic device’s screen and instantly converts the text into a spoken form. Text speech technology is really beneficial, especially for kids who are in school. This technology helps the children in learning education and getting knowledge easily. Now it is also used as a basic source in the educational system across the globe.

## Scope

Text to speech converters is relatively new industry, but it is exploding with growth at the moment.  It is not only just about assisted reading, but it is becoming something bigger and more important as the days go by. Mixing text to speech converters and a machine learning how to speak and mimicking humans is going to lead to some next-level technology. Another wild reality is that it could possibly overthrow some forms of education.  The technology is already being used to help people with disabilities and not able to read, but it could advance even more.

## Limitation

The present speech synthesis systems can be successfully used for a wide range of diverse purposes. However, there are serious and important limitations in using various synthesizers. Many of these problems can be identified and resolved. Mainly considered limitations are effect of emotions, ambiguity, prosody, spontaneous speech, preprocessing, text analysis, naturalness, disadvantages related to different types of systems, etc.

## Future Scope

Text to speech converters is relatively new industry, but it is exploding with growth at the moment.  It is not only just about assisted reading, but it is becoming something bigger and more important as the days go by. Mixing text to speech converters and a machine learning how to speak and mimicking humans is going to lead to some next-level technology.

The technology is already being used to help people with disabilities and not able to read, but it could advance even more.
	Another wild reality is that it could possibly overthrow some forms of education.  The technology is already being used to help people with disabilities and not able to read, but it could advance even more. It could be a possibility that text to speech converters end up taking over the education system because it would be cheaper for a school to pay a converter than a full-time teacher employee!  Even though that would be a long way away before it would happen, it is still a crazy thought to ponder.
	The only thing that we do right now is wait and see how the text to speech world is going to change.  Not only are the converters getting better with their methods, but the entire industry has the ability to make a lasting impact very soon.  Keep your eyes peeled to see which industries it will affect and how many lives it will impact.

##  Conclusion


Text to speech synthesis is a rapidly growing aspect of computer technology and is increasingly playing a more important role in the way we interact with the system and interfaces across a variety of platforms. We have identified the various operations and processes involved in text to speech synthesis. We have also developed a very simple and attractive graphical user interface which allows the user to type in his/her text provided in the text field in the application. Our system interfaces with a text to speech engine developed for American English.
